# 📁 Skill-Based Organization Fix

## 🐛 Problem

Books were not being organized by skills as expected. Issues found:

1. **Directory Not Created**: Skills folders were created but books weren't downloaded to them
2. **Wrong Location**: Books were downloaded to `/books/` instead of `/books_by_skills/{skill}/Books/`
3. **Error**: `[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'books_by_skills/Machine Learning'`

## 🔍 Root Cause

The download script was changing to the skill directory (`os.chdir(skill_dir)`) before calling the book downloader, but:

1. The downloader (`core.py`) uses `PATH` from `config.py` which is the project root
2. When running from a different directory, relative paths broke
3. The "Books" subdirectory was being created in the wrong place

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Environment Variable Approach**

Instead of changing directories, we now use an environment variable to tell the downloader where to save books:

```python
# In download_books.py
os.environ['OREILLY_OUTPUT_PATH'] = str(skill_dir.absolute())
```

### 2. **Updated Core Downloader**

Modified `oreilly_books/core.py` to check for the custom output path:

```python
# In core.py
output_base = os.environ.get('OREILLY_OUTPUT_PATH', PATH)
self.book_downloader.BOOK_PATH = os.path.join(output_base, "Books", f"{book_title} ({book_id})")
```

### 3. **Proper Directory Creation**

Added `parents=True` to all directory creation calls:

```python
skill_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

## 📁 New Folder Structure

Books are now organized as:

```
books_by_skills/
├── Machine Learning/
│   └── Books/
│       ├── Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition (9781098125967)/

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Files Modified:

1. **`download_books.py`**
   - Set `OREILLY_OUTPUT_PATH` environment variable before downloading
   - Clean up environment variable after download
   - Added `parents=True` to directory creation
   - Removed `os.chdir()` approach

2. **`oreilly_books/core.py`**
   - Check for `OREILLY_OUTPUT_PATH` environment variable
   - Use custom path if set, fall back to default `PATH`

### Key Changes:

```python
# Before (download_books.py)
os.chdir(skill_dir)
downloader = OreillyBooks(args)
os.chdir(original_cwd)

# After (download_books.py)
os.environ['OREILLY_OUTPUT_PATH'] = str(skill_dir.absolute())
downloader = OreillyBooks(args)
# Cleanup environment variable
```

```python
# Before (core.py)
self.book_downloader.BOOK_PATH = os.path.join(PATH, "Books", f"{book_title} ({book_id})")

# After (core.py)
output_base = os.environ.get('OREILLY_OUTPUT_PATH', PATH)
self.book_downloader.BOOK_PATH = os.path.join(output_base, "Books", f"{book_title} ({book_id})")
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **✅ Proper Organization**: Books grouped by skills
2. **✅ Clean Structure**: Each skill has its own folder
3. **✅ No Path Issues**: Works with absolute paths
4. **✅ Backward Compatible**: Falls back to default if env var not set
5. **✅ Easy to Navigate**: Clear folder hierarchy

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

When you run:
```bash
python3 download_books.py --skills "Machine Learning" --max-books 3
```

You'll get:
```
books_by_skills/
└── Machine Learning/
    └── Books/
        ├── Book 1/
        ├── Book 2/
        └── Book 3/
```

Each book folder contains:
- EPUB file(s) (enhanced and/or kindle versions)
- OEBPS/ directory with content
- All book resources

## 🔄 Migration

### Old Downloads

Books previously downloaded to `/books/` will stay there. They won't be moved automatically.

### New Downloads

All new downloads will go to `/books_by_skills/{skill}/Books/{book}/`

### Clean Start

If you want to start fresh with the new organization:

```bash
# Backup old downloads (optional)
mv books books_backup

# Clean up and restart
python3 oreilly_automation.py --cleanup
python3 download_books.py
```

## 🚀 Usage

Everything works the same, but now books are organized by skills:

```bash
# Download books for specific skills
python3 download_books.py --skills "Python" "Machine Learning"

# Download all skills
python3 download_books.py

# Check progress
python3 oreilly_automation.py --progress
```

## 📊 Result

Books are now properly organized by skills, making it easy to:
- Find books by topic
- Share skill-specific collections
- Manage large libraries
- Navigate your downloaded content

The fix is automatic and requires no changes to how you run the scripts! 🎉
