# About 
This is a very simple script for retrieving a list of book ID's from OReilly's online book library: https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/

Once you have all the book IDs, you can use the program in the repository below to download them as an `.epub` file.

For your convenience, the book IDs for selected topics are given in the accompanying `.txt` files.
