# Path Structure Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Book Download Path ✅

**Before:**
```
books_by_skills/
└── [Skill Name]/
    └── Books/                    ← Extra directory
        └── [Book Title (ID)]/
            ├── OEBPS/
            └── *.epub
```

**After:**
```
books_by_skills/
└── [Skill Name]/
    └── [Book Title (ID)]/       ← Direct path
        ├── OEBPS/
        └── *.epub
```

**Fixed in:** `oreilly_books/core.py`
- Removed "Books" directory from path construction
- Simplified to: `skill_name/book_name` instead of `skill_name/Books/book_name`

### 2. Added Live Progress to Quick Download ✅

**Before:**
- Commands ran silently with captured output
- No real-time progress visible
- User had to wait without feedback

**After:**
- Live output streams to console
- Real-time progress bars and status
- User sees exactly what's happening

**Fixed in:** `quick_download.py`
- Modified `run_command()` to support live output
- Added `show_output=True` parameter for main commands
- Discovery and download now show real-time progress

## Usage

Everything works the same, but now:

1. **Cleaner paths:**
   ```bash
   books_by_skills/Python/Book Title (123456)/Book.epub
   # Instead of:
   # books_by_skills/Python/Books/Book Title (123456)/Book.epub
   ```

2. **Better progress visibility:**
   ```bash
   python3 quick_download.py
   # Now shows live progress during discovery and download
   ```

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler structure** - One less directory level  
✅ **Easier navigation** - Direct path to books  
✅ **Better UX** - Live progress feedback  
✅ **More intuitive** - Path matches expectation  

## Migration

If you have books in the old structure with "Books" directories:

```bash
# Move books from old structure to new
cd books_by_skills
for skill in */; do
    if [ -d "$skill/Books" ]; then
        mv "$skill/Books"/* "$skill/"
        rmdir "$skill/Books"
    fi
done
```

Or simply delete old downloads and re-download with the new structure.
