# O'Reilly Book Downloader - Improvements Quick Reference

## üéØ What's New

### 1. Token Refresh Fix ‚úÖ
**Problem Solved:** Books were failing with JSON parse errors after a few downloads.

**How It Works:** Cookies are now automatically updated after EVERY HTTP request, keeping authentication fresh indefinitely.

**No Action Needed:** This works automatically in the background.

---

### 2. Smart EPUB Detection ‚úÖ
**What Changed:** The script now checks if EPUB files actually exist on disk before downloading.

**Benefits:**
- More reliable skip logic
- Works even if progress file is corrupted
- Respects different EPUB formats (legacy, enhanced, kindle, dual)

**Example:**
```bash
# First run: Downloads books
python3 download_books.py --skills "Python" --max-books 5

# Second run: Skips books (EPUB files exist)
python3 download_books.py --skills "Python" --max-books 5
# Output: ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping <book> (EPUB already exists)
```

---

### 3. Force Redownload Option ‚úÖ
**Use Case:** Update existing books with new versions or corrections.

**How to Use:**

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Force re-download all books
python3 download_books.py --force

# Force re-download specific skills
python3 download_books.py --skills "Python" "Machine Learning" --force
```

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
python3 quick_download.py
# Select option 5: "Force re-download all books (updates existing)"
```

**Configuration File:**
```json
{
  "force_redownload": true
}
```

---

### 4. Configurable Token Refresh ‚úÖ
**What It Does:** Controls how often authentication cookies are saved to disk.

**Default:** Every 5 books (recommended)

**How to Change:**

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Save tokens more frequently (every 2 books)
python3 download_books.py --token-save-interval 2

# Save tokens less frequently (every 10 books)
python3 download_books.py --token-save-interval 10
```

**Configuration File:**
```json
{
  "token_save_interval": 5
}
```

**When to Adjust:**
- **Lower (2-3)**: If you experience occasional authentication errors
- **Default (5)**: Good for most users
- **Higher (10+)**: If tokens are stable and you want fewer disk writes

## üéì Best Practices

### First Time Download
```bash
# Use defaults - they work great
python3 download_books.py
```

### Updating Your Library
```bash
# Force re-download books that may have been updated
python3 download_books.py --force
```

### Experiencing Token Issues?
```bash
# Save tokens more frequently
python3 download_books.py --token-save-interval 2 --verbose

# Check logs for cookie updates
grep "Saved authentication cookies" logs/book_downloader.log
```

### Large Library Download
```bash
# Default settings are optimized for large downloads
python3 download_books.py --max-books 100

# Tokens refresh automatically after every HTTP request
# Cookies saved to disk every 5 books by default
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" Error
**This should no longer happen!** The token refresh fix prevents this.

If you still see it:
1. Refresh your `cookies.json` file
2. Lower token save interval: `--token-save-interval 2`
3. Check logs: `grep "Updated cookie" logs/book_downloader.log`

### Books Re-downloading When They Shouldn't
1. Verify `--force` flag is NOT being used
2. Check config: `"force_redownload": false`
3. Ensure EPUB files contain the book ID in their filename

### Force Redownload Not Working
1. Confirm `--force` flag is present
2. Look for "Force re-downloading:" in logs
3. Try command line instead of config file
