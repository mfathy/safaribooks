# Discover V1 Updates - October 2025

## Summary
Updated the `discover_book_ids.py` script with improved validation rules and pagination logic to ensure more accurate book discovery.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed 10% Buffer (Line 210)
**Before:**
```python
target_book_count = int(expected_book_count * 1.1)  # 10% buffer
```

**After:**
```python
target_book_count = expected_book_count  # No buffer
```

**Rationale:** The 10% buffer was causing unnecessary over-fetching. Now we fetch exactly the expected count.

---

### 2. Decreased Title Length Validation (Line 260)
**Before:**
```python
if len(title.strip()) < 10:
    self.logger.debug(f"⏭️  Skipping short title: {title}")
    continue
```

**After:**
```python
if len(title.strip()) < 5:
    self.logger.debug(f"⏭️  Skipping short title: {title}")
    continue
```

**Rationale:** Some legitimate books have shorter titles. Reduced from 10 to 5 characters to be more inclusive.

---

### 3. Updated Chapter Keywords - Preserved "Parts" (Lines 264-279)
**Before:**
```python
chapter_keywords = [
    'chapter', 'part', 'section', 'lesson', 'unit', 'module',
    'part i:', 'part ii:', 'part iii:', 'part iv:', 'part v:',
    ...
]
```

**After:**
```python
chapter_keywords = [
    'chapter', 'section', 'lesson', 'unit', 'module',
    # Removed 'part' and 'part i:', 'part ii:', etc.
    ...
]
```

**Rationale:** Books with "part" or "parts" in the title are legitimate books (e.g., "Python Parts: Essential Tools for Developers"). Only skip specific chapter/section markers.

---

### 4. Added Subject Validation (Lines 314-328)
**New Code:**
```python
# 5. Subject validation - must include the skill or variant
subjects = book.get('subjects', []) or book.get('topics', [])
skill_variants = self._get_skill_variants(skill_name)

has_matching_subject = False
if subjects:
    subjects_lower = [str(s).lower() for s in subjects]
    for variant in skill_variants:
        if any(variant.lower() in subject for subject in subjects_lower):
            has_matching_subject = True
            break

if subjects and not has_matching_subject:
    self.logger.debug(f"⏭️  Skipping - subjects don't match skill '{skill_name}': {title} (subjects: {subjects})")
    continue
```

**Rationale:** Ensures books are relevant to the skill by checking if the book's subjects contain the skill name or its variants.

---

### 5. Added Topics Validation (Lines 330-342)
**New Code:**
```python
# 6. Topics validation - must include the skill or variant
topics = book.get('topics', [])
has_matching_topic = False
if topics:
    topics_lower = [str(t).lower() for t in topics]
    for variant in skill_variants:
        if any(variant.lower() in topic for topic in topics_lower):
            has_matching_topic = True
            break

if topics and not has_matching_topic:
    self.logger.debug(f"⏭️  Skipping - topics don't match skill '{skill_name}': {title} (topics: {topics})")
    continue
```

**Rationale:** Additional relevance check using the book's topics field to ensure alignment with the skill.

---

### 6. Added Skill Variants Helper Method (Lines 189-214)
**New Method:**
```python
def _get_skill_variants(self, skill_name: str) -> List[str]:
    """Get variants of a skill name for matching subjects/topics
    
    Generates simple separator variants:
    - Original: "Engineering Leadership"
    - Hyphen: "Engineering-Leadership"
    - Underscore: "Engineering_Leadership"
    - Plus: "Engineering+Leadership"
    """
    variants = [skill_name]  # Original with spaces
    skill_lower = skill_name.lower()
    
    # Add separator variants
    if ' ' in skill_lower:
        variants.append(skill_lower.replace(' ', '-'))    # Hyphen
        variants.append(skill_lower.replace(' ', '_'))    # Underscore
        variants.append(skill_lower.replace(' ', '+'))    # Plus
    
    return list(set(variants))
```

**Rationale:** Generates simple separator variants for matching (e.g., "Engineering Leadership" → "engineering leadership", "engineering-leadership", "engineering_leadership", "engineering+leadership").

---

### 7. Updated Pagination Logic - Loop Until Exact Count (Lines 360-363)
**Before:**
```python
if target_book_count and len(all_books) >= target_book_count:
    self.logger.info(f"✓ '{skill_name}': Reached target count ({len(all_books)}/{target_book_count} with 10% buffer)")
    if page > estimated_pages:
        break
```

**After:**
```python
if target_book_count and len(all_books) >= target_book_count:
    self.logger.info(f"✓ '{skill_name}': Reached target count ({len(all_books)}/{target_book_count})")
    break
```

**Rationale:** Stops pagination immediately when the exact count is reached, improving efficiency.

---

### 8. Skip Skills with >500 Books (Lines 201-215)
**New Code:**
```python
# Skip if book count is greater than 500
if expected_book_count > 500:
    self.logger.warning(f"⏭️  Skipping '{skill_name}': Book count ({expected_book_count}) exceeds 500")
    with self.progress_lock:
        self.skipped_skills.add(skill_name)
    return {
        'skill': skill_name,
        'total_books': 0,
        'expected_books': expected_book_count,
        'book_ids': [],
        'books_info': [],
        'success': True,
        'skipped': True,
        'reason': 'Book count exceeds 500'
    }
```

**Rationale:** Skips overly broad skills with >500 books to focus on more specific, manageable skill categories.

---

### 9. Updated Summary Reporting (Lines 609-615, 640-646, 662-664, 693)
**Changes:**
- Added `skipped_skills` counter tracking
- Updated summary logs to show skipped skills count
- Added list of skipped skill names to final summary
- Updated summary file to include skipped skills

**Example Output:**
```
Skipped skills (>500 books): 5
  Skipped skill list: Business, Programming, Web Development, Data Science, Cloud Computing
```

---

## Usage Example

```bash
# Run discovery with updated validation
python3 discover_book_ids.py

# Run for specific skills
python3 discover_book_ids.py --skills "Engineering Leadership" "AI"

# With verbose logging to see validation details
python3 discover_book_ids.py --verbose
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **More Accurate Results**: Subject and topic validation ensures books are relevant to the skill
2. **Better Performance**: Exact count pagination stops fetching when target is reached
3. **Focused Discovery**: Skills >500 books are skipped to focus on specific topics
4. **Flexible Matching**: Skill variants catch books tagged with different naming conventions
5. **Preserved Content**: Books with "parts" in titles are no longer incorrectly filtered out

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with "Engineering Leadership" skill to verify validation works
2. Compare book counts before/after to measure impact
3. Review debug logs to see what's being filtered and why
4. Verify skipped skills are actually >500 books
5. Check that "parts" books are now included in results
