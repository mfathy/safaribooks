‚úÖ UPDATED VALIDATIONS:

1. Title Length: Now accepts titles >= 5 characters (was 10)
   - Example: "R Tips" would now pass validation
   
2. Chapter Keywords: Removed 'part' and 'parts'
   - Books like "Python Parts: Essential Tools" are now included
   
3. Subject Validation: NEW - Books must have matching subjects
   - Checks if book subjects contain the skill or its variants
   - Example: For "Engineering Leadership", checks for:
     * "engineering leadership"
     * "engineering"
     * "leadership"
     * "engineering-leadership"
     * etc.
     
4. Topics Validation: NEW - Books must have matching topics
   - Similar to subject validation but for topics field
   
5. Pagination: Stops at EXACT count (no 10% buffer)
   - Fetches exactly the expected number of books
   
6. Skip Large Skills: Skills with >500 books are skipped
   - Focuses discovery on specific, manageable topics
